The very last line extends\r\nthrough the end of the source string and has no line delimiter.\r\nFor example, the source string <code>class A\\n{\\n}<\/code> has 3 lines\r\ncorresponding to inclusive character ranges [0,8], [8,9], and [10,10].\r\nReturns 1 for a character position that does not correspond to any\r\nsource line, or if no line number information is available for this\r\ncompilation unit.\r\n\r\n@param position a 0-based character position, possibly\r\n  negative or out of range\r\n@return the 1-based line number, or <code>1<\/code> if the character\r\n   position does not correspond to a source line in the original\r\n   source file or if line number information is not known for this\r\n   compilation unit\r\n@see AST#parseCompilationUnit"
