org.eclipse.jdt.core.tests.model.AllJavaModelTests will visit each of
the included test cases and call its suite() method over reflection to
instantiate the test case. If the suite() method is not found, an
exception stack trace is printed instead of throwing an exception. So
forgetting the suite() method in a new test case does not result in a
failure. This can easily hide the fact that the new test case is not
running at all.

This change re-throws the exception instead of only printing its stack
trace, so that missing suite() method in an included test case results
in a failure.

External annotation locations of an individual jar are in sync i.e. updating the external annotation location for rt.jar in JRE of P1 or JRE of P2 or via preference page, updates/overwrites the location at all the places. </td> </tr>

Here's what I see after clean build:
- in the Problems view only one error is shown
- both editors show the error


OK, it's the per project settings that confuse the reconciler (and hence the editor). For the JRE we _could_ even disable this option (to force the workspace-wide setting). Unfortunately, this doesn't help for other containers like requiredPlugins, mavenDependencies etc..

And: there may be good reason to have each project manage its own external annotations. In my testing I typically used F3 navigation and in that case *usually* the class file editor "knows" to which project it belongs. By invoking Open-Type you have bypassed this route and we need to consult the breadcrumbs to even know, via which path the type was reached.

The two side of the issue are:

- When looking at a library class, the "Annotate" command and hovers with annotations need to know the Java project in charge (since I don't want to multiplex into all projects). This is the hard part.

- When reconciling the content of a source editor, JDT/Core needs to view the class file via the current project's classpath - this is only hampered by caching / sharing the same ClassFile. This can be fixed behind the scenes in JDT/Core.


I'll perform some more experiments to chart the options we have. </td> </tr>

        <tr> <td colspan="2" style="font-size: 12px; background-color:#f7fff0"> OK, all the confusion can indeed be traced back to how caching works in the Java model, versus the desire to view a class file relative to the context of a "current project", in order to decorate the class file with annotation information as found in that project's classpath.

Caching considers "the type j.u.Map as seen from P1" as equals to "the type j.u.Map as seen from P2", which means that the answer from
   classFile.getAncestor(IJavaElement.JAVA_PROJECT)
produces unreliable information. It does not indicate via which project a class file was found, but rather: along which path we *first* found this class file (roughly speaking).

The Java model applies the above logic under the assumption, that class files having the same path are the same. Looking at the classfile itself this is sound. And: normally, the containing IJavaProject isn't relevant (for library class files).

The only way for a user to see the difference is via bread crumbs, but even that information is not reliable (I saw a BinaryType, which was rooted in project P1, reported as a child of a ClassFile rooted in project P2), IOW:
   type.getAncestor(IJavaElement.JAVA_PROJECT)
      != type.getParent().getAncestor(IJavaElement.JAVA_PROJECT)
Looks weird, but as mentioned: normally this isn't relevant.

This situation changes with per-project external annotations: now the class file carries information (location of external annotations) which applies only within the context of a specific project.
I have a draft change in my workspace, which simply extends equality of ClassFile to also consider an external annotation location if defined. 
Note to self: the key location where this equality makes a difference is inside ClassFile.existsUsingJarTypeCache(), see in particular manager.getInfo(type).

This simple fix seems to resolve the confusion that causes all the various symptoms in this bug.

The effect is: now the same library class may be represented by different ClassFiles, if annotation locations differ. This may increase memory consumption / decrease cache quality. Furthermore, we may see different class file editors for the same target file (depending on the navigation path).

        <tr> <td colspan="2" style="font-size: 12px; background-color:#f7fff0"> Sorry, Noopur, if it seems that I'm turning the direction of your report. 

I understand that you expected the following:
When invoking "Annotate" an a library class that is referenced in several projects, all of which are configured for external annotations, the command should affect all of those projects.
This perspective regards a library class as an independent entity, with no clear ownership by any workspace project.

If we fully elaborate that perspective I see the following problems:
If per-project configuration is used, it may happen that different projects define different annotations for the same method (.eea files can be manually edited / moved / copied, projects can be imported from different sources etc. pp.).
In this situation, when we consider the library class as context-free, asking for the existing annotations can produce contradictory answers (contributed by different projects).
As an effect, we would not be able to show annotations in Javadoc hovers (since we cannot decide which variant to show).
Also the Annotate command needs to know the existing annotations, in order to select 2 out of 3 possible proposals (add @NonNull, add @Nullable, remove existing). This, too, cannot work if we want to operate on multiple projects' .eea files simultaneously. Merging a new annotation into different existing signatures adds more complexity, which is hard/impossible to explain to the user.


From this I conclude that first of all, shared library classes should preferably have a single annotation location for the entire workspace.
For the JRE we will recommend in the documentation to attach annotations via the JRE preferences, not via the project build path.
For other classpath containers this is not possible, but we can still recommend that annotation attachment in different projects point to a common location in one project, which the other projects depend on.
IOW: the primary strategy should be to avoid the situation of split annotation locations for the same library as much as possible.
I will consider this when writing the help page for this feature.


Still, the situation of split locations will occur. In fact even configuring only a subset of your workspace projects for external annotations will already create a variant of this split. Hence we definitely need to find a consistent story also for these scenarii.

My entry towards this consistent story is the perspective that everything we do in JDT happens in the context of a Java project. In some situations this should be obvious, in others we may need to help the user to understand this perspective:
- When working with Java source in an editor, calls into a library must be checked against the external annotations defined in this project's configuration.
- When navigating (F3) from a Java source editor of project P1 into a library class (w/ source attachment), we need to see the annotations in the context of project P1, and Annotate should only affect this project.
- Open type is the hardest part, since here the UI hides that fact, that all classes available for selection are indeed found via some project's classpath.
- Editor bread crumbs may come to our rescue as the preferred means for showing the current project context (Package Explorer's "link to editor" can provide the same information).


I see that technically JDT's Java model reflects this exact perspective: every IJavaElement (incl. IClassFile) has an ancestor of type IJavaProject. Hence I'm focussing on identifying where and why this perspective is "broken". From a UI perspective "Open Type" is the hotspot. Internally, class file caching is the trouble maker. </td> </tr>

I assume this happened when the IClassFile for Map was first accessed via the project without annotation-based null analysis. In that case the Java model cache will always answer this same IClassFile and its IJavaProject ancestor will always be the un-configured project.

Technically, the main entry is to change the definition of equality for JarPackageFragmentRoot;s, as to include the external annotation path. This is done so we can distinguish different views of a library class: viewed via classpath entries with different annotation configurations. 
I realize that such change needs discussion, and I will provide a summary of why and how, when needed.

On top there's one question, for which I currently don't have a good answer:
In order to include an external annotation path in the equals/hashCode methods of JarPackageFragmentRoot this path needs to be initialized eagerly (to ensure stability of equals/hashCode). This initialization needs the classpath of the enclosing java project to be resolved.
For the majority of call paths, the classpath is already resolved at the point when a JarPackageFragmentRoot is created, but there are also call paths from public API into these constructors. I'm afraid that for the sake of this API it may not be acceptable to require classpath resolution during handle creation.

Unless s.o. has a good idea how to feed the classpath attribute into this handle creation, we may have to postpone the entire story to after 4.5.0. Would targeting 4.6M1 + 4.5.1 be a viable option? </td> </tr>

Then we'd need a specific value for an uninitialized annotation path to distinguish this from a real null.

Yes this is pretty similar, but it refers to other complications.

As well as chopping and changing between P1 and P2 that are workspace projects, it should be possible for one or both to be installed plugins.

This highlights PDE issues not considered by JDT. As far as the IDE user is concerned projects and installed plugins should be identical source-wise. Consequently the MANIFEST.MF/plugin.xml/build.properties should be the primary definition of the annotation path from which the current .classpath entries could be derived (automatically) by the standard PDE "update classpath settings". IMHO it is unacceptable that null annotations are an IDE-specific functionality that breaks once distributed to users as installed plugins. </td> </tr>

It's certainly challenging, but the Javadoc applies to a particular code context at which a hierarchy of declarations are visible potentially each with different external annotations.

It is certainly preferable but unfortunately unrealistic. Eclipse is a multi-project IDE.

IMHO anything that relies on a workspace setting to make project functionality correct guarantees that two users collaborating via a GIT repo for their project get confused. It must be possible to have explicit project settings that make the correct operation of one project independent of other projects. </td> </tr>

I think you already filed a bug for the enhancement, right? A change in this direction must be driven from PDE, possibly backed by new API from JDT as needed. Do you care to join forces to make this happen in PDE?


This current bug in JDT focuses on intermittent problems were the same library is referenced from several projects, such that shared caching interferes with per-project decoration with .eea. </td> </tr>

I'm afraid that my knowledge of the JDT and PDE code bases is tiny, and the problem is non-trivial; hardly suitable for a newbie. I'm afraid I can only offer my intuition from similar fields. Also I'm way behind schedule on my own projects...

> using workspace settings were given only as a workaround

External annotations are themselves just a workaround so we have a problem that a well-intentioned workaround has horrible unforeseen complexities. So the choice is to follow through on the complexities or revisit the workaround.

----

Instinctively I feel that maintaining distinct java.util.Map types for each usage is horrible, and I'm not sure it can be sound. Consider

myMap = myFunctionReturningYourMap()

How are the conflicting Map annotations accommodated?

----

Given any piece of Java code, it should often be possible for experienced Java programmers (automated analysis) to agree whether the code assumes an @NonNull input or checks for an @Nullable input and whether the return is @NonNull or @Nullable. This agreement can extend to the available overrides.

There may be some Javadoc that confirms or conflicts with the code analysis.

Third party overrides may make unjustified assumptions about the nullity of overridden parameters/returns.

However there is in principle a single correct annotation of each declaration and so external annotations are attempting to provide that one correct annotation.

Therefore adding correct external annotations from another project should not do any harm; just highlight additional unsafe/redundant null usages. All correct external annotations from all projects can therefore be merged and used by all projects that enable null annotation analysis. (Projects that do not enable null annotation analysis use the annotated declarations and show them in hover text; however no diagnostics result.)

Informal limitation: external annotations may not be used to impose design-policy constraints that are not in accord with the code. e.g. it is not permitted to annotate the return of Object.toString() as non-null.

Two problems remain.

a) conflicts between external annotations must be diagnosed by INFOs and a best resolution chosen by heuristic

b) my project must be able to override your bad external declarations pending a consensus has been reached on the correct annotations

Therefore add an ability to have per-project override-annotations to remove known bad annotations from the workspace.

Diagnose conflicting override-annotations as WARNINGs and resolve the conflict as no-annotations.

----

Perhaps rather than override-annotations, the existing annotations might be qualified by a confidence

1 - derived from stylized Javadoc
2 - derived by manual analysis
3 - derived by local code analysis
4 - derived by global code analysis
5 - defined by design policy
9 - overriding a conflict

----

If in my Java file I get a nullity violation on some declaration, the source of the external annotations on that declaration can be used to identify whether I want to know about the diagnostic and what severity to give it.

Therefore there is only one declaration in the workspace, but there can be project preferences that enable me to suppress inappropriate diagnostics. </td> </tr>

I'm not a big fan of utopian indexes so I'm not disappointed that your 'newindex' is falling through. Instinctively this seems wrong anyway. At the Java core level there is a core definition of each class and its features; in many cases this involves erasure for compatibility reasons.

External annotations define a locally-applicable adjusted type that is actually a lie. Pushing conflicting local lies into a utopian index seems doomed to failure.

Rather it seems that the JDT core should use the single true declaration throughout, but that certain algorithms should use the locally relevant adjusted type. Thus hovertext/outline/completion-assist/type-conformance/... should use the AdjustedClass applicable to the locally applicable annotation path.

NB When I use F3 to examine e.g. java.util.Map, which does not share the same local annotation-path, I should get a read-only viewer for the adjusted java.util.Map. cf the read-only viewer for class files. Within the viewer, there might be a navigation to other adjustments.

Once it is recognised that some algorithms use an AdjustedClass, the downstream viewing/usage problem is 'solved'. The upstream problem of determining and unifying the AdjustedClass is tractable. Where a reference to Y occurs within some class X, we compute the AdjustedClass for Y by unifying all annotations for Y from 'all' elements of the annotation-path of X's bundle (which might be an installed plugin).

Conflicts between multiple annotation path entries are troublesome. I won't revisit my earlier comment.

Many conflicts between interface and implementation can perhaps be ignored. The implementation has its own adjusted type that may or may not be better than the interface's adjusted type. However outright stupidities such as the interface imposing @Nullable and the implementation imposing @NonNull should be warnings at each point of usage. (A separate UI might offer an opportunity to view annotation path inconsistencies.) </td> </tr>

Implementationwise we need to go back to the drawing board.

Scratch the idea, that superimposing external annotations can/should happen at the level of Java Model's ClassFile? This guy is sharable among different views and hence must show the global naked truth.

For compiler use cases we may be able to push that superimposition into the various INameEnvironments, which are indeed meant to represent one project's view of the world. Name environments have successfully been adjusted to provide per-project views wrt JPMS. Integrating external annotations at that level seems feasible.

A name environment based approach will, however, not solve the issue of showing a decorated class file in an editor. And if we don't have per-project views of class files in an editor, we cannot implement the Ctrl+1 Annotation command. Bummer.

In this situation, yes, considering a Java Model-level AdjustedClass extends ClassFile should be considered. The difficulty in this approach lies in identifying all call sites requesting a ClassFile that need to be extended to apply decorating with AdjustedClass. The number of call sites may be huge.

Since all my reasoning here is focused on ClassFile, we should also link to the topic of decorating source code with external annotations. Do you have a bug # at hand, where this is being discussed?


Still, the previous ideas from comment 5 up-to comment 11 may have some value, too.

Here's my new take, combining two concepts:

(1) Include all IClasspathAttribute;s in hashCode()/equals() of a JarPackageFragmentRoot (incl. subclasses), in order to avoid undue sharing.

(2) Include those attributes also in handle mementos, so that creating a handle from memento (at which point the project's resolved classpath may not be available for lookup of extra attributes) has all the necessary information at hand.

Now, when creating a JarPackageFragmentRoot
- some callers readily provide the attributes (from memento or from cp-entry)
- some callers provide the initialize JavaProject with resolved classpath from where the attributes can be retrieved at very low cost
* if none of the above helps (shouldn't happen), the JPFR will have null extraAttributes, which only means that it is not equals() to any JPFR *with* extraAttributes.

When introducint a new JEM delimiter for classpath attributes, I studied bug 430136, chose a char ('§') which should be of minimal risk and also applied the escaping strategy introduced in bug 430136. For any existing mementos without the new field, handle creation should work with no problem, because this new field is purely optional.

Most importantly: the new contribution to equals()/hashCode() is *immutable*.

MementoTests show the new mementos at work in full roundtrip, both on a regular JarPackageFragmentRoot and also on a JrtPackageFragmentRoot plus children.

New tests in ExternalAnnotations17Test show the payload: two projects can now see differently annotated classfiles of the same shared lib.

I'm confident that this is better than any previous attempt.

If no immediate objections, I'd like to push this on Sunday, so that we have a chance to test this in the field before 4.10 release. Still after pushing I'll be happy to react to comments / reviews, worst case: revert. </td> </tr>

Using non-ascii char '§' was probably not a good idea. While locally it worked, both new memento tests failed on Jenkins. Replaced by repeated use of escaped JEM_PACKAGEFRAGMENTROOT -> only internally mapped to its own MementoTokenizer.CLASSPATH_ATTRIBUTE.

Resolving the classpath from within JarPackageFragmentRoot.<init> caused failures in ClasspathInitializerTests. Avoided by better checking availability using perProjectInfo.unresolvedEntryStatus.

Regressions in JavaElementDelta related tests have been fixed by better integrating the new strategy with DeltaProcessor.RootInfo: we have an IClasspathEntry at hand, so use its extraAttributes.
